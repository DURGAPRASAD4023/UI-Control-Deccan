# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This project is a web application that allows users to upload a JSON file, parse it, and view the results. The parsing logic is based on a Python script provided by the user. The application features a modern, responsive design with a professional look and feel.

## Implemented Features

### Design and Styling

*   **Modern Design System**:
    *   **`src/index.css`**: Implemented a new color palette with CSS variables for primary, secondary, text, background, card background, border, and shadow colors. The default font has been changed to 'Poppins'.
    *   **`index.html`**: Added Google Fonts links for 'Poppins' and 'Roboto Mono' to ensure consistent typography.
    *   **`src/App.css`**: Updated all styles to use the new CSS variables, resulting in a cohesive and modern design. Improved the layout, spacing, and visual hierarchy of all components.
*   **Responsive Layout**: Ensured the application is fully responsive and works well on all screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.

### Core Components

*   **`src/components/Navbar.jsx` & `src/components/Navbar.css`**:
    *   A sleek navigation bar that displays the Deccan AI logo with a transparent background, updated to match the new design system.
*   **`src/components/Loader.jsx` & `src/components/Loader.css`**:
    *   A professional loading animation with a "pulse" effect for the logo.
    *   Uses a logo with a transparent background displayed on a blurred glass panel for a modern look.
*   **`src/components/Footer.jsx` & `src/components/Footer.css`**:
    *   A professional footer with a modern design, aligned with the new design system.

### JSON Parsing and Display

*   **`src/App.jsx`**:
    *   Integration of all components into a seamless user experience.
    *   **Improved File Handling**: After a file is uploaded and processed, the file input is replaced with a "Download Parsed JSON" button and a "Parse Another File" button. This declutters the interface and provides a clear workflow for the user.
    *   A `loading` state to provide visual feedback during processing.
    *   Implementation of `double_json_loads` logic in JavaScript to parse the uploaded file.
    *   Clear and organized display of the parsed JSON data, including `question`, `steps`, and `response_to_user`.
*   **`src/components/Step.jsx`**:
    *   A component to display each step of the parsed JSON in a visually appealing card format. The component now properly formats and displays nested objects within the steps.

### Bug Fixes

*   **Image Asset Handling**:
    *   Corrected an issue where logos were not visible on the deployed application.
    *   Updated `Navbar.jsx` and `Loader.jsx` to import logo images directly. This ensures that the image paths are correctly resolved by the build process, making them visible on all devices.
    *   Renamed `src/assets/download (1).png` to `src/assets/deccan-ai-logo.png` for better clarity.
*   **Mobile File Upload**:
    *   Fixed an issue where users on some mobile devices could not upload JSON files.
    *   Removed the `accept=".json"` attribute from the file input to allow for a broader range of file selections. The application still validates that the uploaded file is a valid JSON.
*   **Responsive Layout and Button Overflow**:
    *   **CSS Box Model Fix**: Applied a global `box-sizing: border-box;` rule in `src/index.css`. This resolves the issue where the "Upload JSON" button was overflowing its container on mobile devices by ensuring that padding and borders are included in the element's total width.
    *   **Refined Mobile Styles**: Adjusted padding, font sizes, and container styles in `src/App.css` to provide a more polished and visually balanced layout on smaller screens.

## Deployment

The application has been successfully deployed to Firebase Hosting and is publicly accessible.

*   **Hosting URL**: [https://deccan-ai-parser.web.app](https://deccan-ai-parser.web.app)

## Current Plan

All planned features and design improvements have been implemented. The application is in a stable and polished state. I am ready for the next set of instructions or feedback.
